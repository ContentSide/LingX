# LingX

**A library for introducing state-of-the-art metrics on measuring linguistic complexity developed by ContentSide and CRITT at Kent State University.**

---

**LingX is:**  

- A library for calculating some of the psycholinguistics complexity metrics.  
- A library for obtaining helpful metrics for translational process studies.  
- A library for different factors related to the text analysis.  

---

**How does LingX generally work?**

LingX calculates different token-based and segment-based mono-bilingual complexity metrics. It internaly parses a given text into a dependency grammar graph. Using the graph and other linguistic information such as part-of-speech tagging, it can caculates different psycholinguistics, linguistic and translational process metrics. See the reference section for detailed information.  

LingX uses [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) state-of-the-arts NLP library for different language-based tasks. Stanza is a collection of accurate and efficient tools for the linguistic analysis of many human languages. Stanza brings state-of-the-art NLP models to different languages.

## Quick Start

### Requirements and Installation

The project is based on Stanza 1.2.1 and Python 3.6+. If you do not have Python 3.6, install it first. Then, in your favorite virtual environment, simply do:

```
pip install lingx
```

### Example Usage

Let's run a simple token-based incomplete dependencies difficulty measure. All you need to do is to make import related methode as follows:

```python
from lingx.idt import get_nested_np_modifiers_score
from lingx.tools.critt 
```

This should print:

```console
from lingx.metrics.bilingual import get_nested_np_modifiers_score
from lingx.utils.critt 
```

## Tutorials

We provide a set of quick tutorials to get you started with the library:

* [Tutorial 1: Installation](/docs/TUTORIAL_1_BASICS.md)
* [Tutorial 2: Getting Psycholingual Metrics](/docs/TUTORIAL_2_PSYCHOLINGUAL.md)
* [Tutorial 3: Getting Monolingual Metrics](/docs/TUTORIAL_3_MONOLINGUAL.md)
* [Tutorial 4: Getting Bilingual Metrics](/docs/TUTORIAL_4_BILINGUAL.md)
* [Tutorial 5: Reading and Working with CRITT TPR-DB ](/docs/TUTORIAL_5_CRITT.md)

The tutorials explain how the base metrics can be obtained. Let us know if anything is unclear.
